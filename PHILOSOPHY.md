[LEGEND]
PRINCIPLE = A durable rule that trades off local optimization for global clarity.

[CONTENT]
This repo prefers principles ([PRINCIPLE]) that optimize for long-term clarity:
- Contracts over conventions.
- Deterministic checks over “works on my machine”.
- Small, reversible changes over heroic refactors.
